# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- The purpose of this web page was to create a workspace for gaining repitition in Git workflow as well as practicing linking skills that I had otherwise practiced separately.
- I built this page to use as a reference point for future projects if I am unsure of formatting or how different files should link in a given project.
- I learned several useful things such as how to interact with Github through a terminal, the function of Git, and how version control works.
